    Hello! I am Prastuti! I like to code and I like to draw.  I am in fifth grade and I'm 11 years old.  My birhday is on September 27th.  Some cool facts about me is that I have been to a lot of places around the world. Another cool fact is that I was in spell bowl and I was in 1st place. My favorite thing to do when I'm bored is to draw and code. My favorite dessert is cheesecake and my favorite food is fried rice. That's all about me!
